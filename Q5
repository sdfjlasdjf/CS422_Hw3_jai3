We would need to discard the entire contents of the <threads> cell:
  rule <k> abort; ~> _ => .K </k>
       <threads> _ => .Bag </threads>

where the <k> cell of the current thread contains abort;. Upon encountering abort;, the rule rewrites the computation to .K, which terminates the current thread's computation.
Also, the <threads> cell is rewritten to .Bag, which effectively discards all existing threads.
