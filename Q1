We can follow the approach of using the Y combinator to express mu:

syntax Exp ::= "mu" Id "." Exp [macro]
rule mu X . E => (lambda X . (E[X / (X X)])) (lambda X . (E[X / (X X)]))

where we translate mu X . E into an application of a lambda expression to itself, capturing the fixed point of E.
With this new semantics of mu, the definition of letrec should remains the same:

syntax Exp ::= "letrec" Id Id "=" Exp "in" Exp [macro]
rule letrec F X = E in E' => let F = mu F . lambda X . E in E'
